Because you're part of our Mid-Life Planners community, we've curated options that keep your premium at $1,833.41. Lock in your rate for the next 24 months and earn 1.5x reward points on timely payments.\n\nIf cost was a concern due to 'Switched providers', let's review flexible payment dates and see if a loyalty discount applies. Access a personalized dashboard comparing this year's coverage upgrades in the Renewal Hub.\n\nReply to this email or use the Renewal Hub link above to complete everything in a few minutes. I'm here if you'd prefer a quick call.\n\nWarm regards,\nPolicy Renewal Team",
